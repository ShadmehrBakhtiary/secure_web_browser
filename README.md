## Overview
This project is a secure web browser implemented in Python using multithreading, SSL, and socket programming. The browser is designed to retrieve and display web page content, including HTML, CSS, and other tags, in a secure manner.

## Features
- Multithreaded programming for improved performance
- Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption for secure communication
- Ability to retrieve web page content, including HTML and CSS


## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (e.g., `socket`, `ssl`, `threading`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
   ```


## Usage
1. Run the main Python script to start the secure web browser:
   ```bash
   python secure_web_browser.py
   ```

2. Enter the URL of the website you want to visit in array.

3. The browser will use multithreading and SSL to securely retrieve and display the web page content.

## Future Improvements
- Implement support for additional web technologies (e.g., JavaScript, cookies)
- Add bookmarking and history features
- Enhance the user interface for a better browsing experience
